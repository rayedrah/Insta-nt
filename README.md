# 📸 Instagram Account Scraper

A research-grade Instagram scraper that extracts all posts from a target account — metadata, captions, likes, dates — and downloads every media file. Built for the **PDID (Profile-based Disinformation Detection)** research pipeline.

## ✦ Features

- 🔍 Scrapes **all posts and reels** from any public Instagram account

- 📊 Outputs a styled **Excel file per account** with clickable media hyperlinks
- 🔁 Supports **multiple accounts** in a single session
- 💾 Saves everything **locally** next to the script — no hardcoded paths

**1. Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rayed_rah/Insta-nt.git

This will:

Enter Instagram username (or 'exit'): nasa
